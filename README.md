## Abstract

How do people determine whether non-human entities have thoughts and feelings — an inner mental life? Prior work has proposed that people use compact sets of dimensions (e.g.,body-heart-mind) to form beliefs about familiar kinds, but how do they generalize to novel entities? Here we investigate emerging beliefs about the mental capacities of large language models (LLMs) and how those beliefs are shaped by how LLMs are portrayed. Participants (N = 470) watched brief videos that encouraged them to view LLMs as either machines, tools, or companions. We found that the companion group more strongly endorsed statements regarding a broad array of mental capacities that LLMs might possess relative to the machine and tool groups, suggesting that people’s beliefs can be rapidly shaped by context. Our study highlights the need to explore the factors shaping people’s beliefs about emerging technologies to promote accurate public understanding.

This study was [pre-registered](https://aspredicted.org/vgdm-gjrm.pdf) with AsPredicted and approved by IRB at Princeton University (#17151).

A copy of the processed rating data can be found in `data/ratings.csv` for convenience. This is identical to the `ratings.csv` file generated by the analysis code.

We have also saved the outputs of all analysis notebooks in Dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/92f4f9dgop88hf3qdxmio/analysis_outputs.zip?rlkey=qxgets6nsj4bufiyytg5up8yn&st=68hdiv8x&dl=0). This is for convenienece. If you run the analysis notebooks, the outputs will save in a new directory called `analysis`.

## Reproducing Analyses

### Prerequisites

Install [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) if you haven't already

### Create Conda Environment

1. Create a conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n portraying_llms python=3.9 -y
```

2. Activate the environment:
```bash
conda activate portraying_llms
```

### Install R Packages
With the conda environment activated, install `R` and necessary packages in the conda environment with `conda install -c conda-forge r-base r-lme4 r-lmerTest r-emmeans r-ggplot2 r-dplyr r-tidyr r-stringr r-psych r-car`.

Note: if there are other packages you would like to install, you can do so using the command `conda install -c conda-forge <package-name>` ensuring that the `r-` prepends each package name.

### Install Python Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: if you have issues downloading the package `rpy2`, remove it from the     `requirements.txt` file, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then manually install `rpy2` with the bash command ` pip install "rpy2==3.5.12"`.

### Running Analysis Code

The main analyses can be found in `code/analysis.ipynb`. Visualizations for graphs found in the paper can be produced using the `code/figures.ipynb`. Trying to run `figure.ipynb` before `analysis.ipynb` will not work. Resulting analyses can be found in a new folder called `analysis`. It is recommended to sequentially run each cell in `analysis.ipynb` to ensure all variables are defined. Exploratory analyses are at the bottom of the file.
